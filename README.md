## Description 

This is project "Image Dehazing Using U-net Architecture with Wavelet Feature Extraction" developed by Sina Shahsavari, Ayman jabaren.

## Abstract 

Image dehazing is an ill-posed problem challenging many computer vision applications. It is an undesirable physical phenomena that occurs while capturing real pictures. Many methods and algorithms were developed for that end. Nonetheless, no generic high-quality solution has been proposed yet. Hence, we are proposing an end-to-end architecture that tackles the problem and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Deep network has shown promising results when it comes to image dehazing. We investigated and harnessed wavelet filterbank properties for feature extraction in U-net neural network. By doing so, we have combined U-net learning properties with image specific efficient features extraction. While enhancing the model performance, we explored the effect of different types of wavelet filterbanks as well as different number of wavelet levels on the quality of image effecting.

## Requirements and Usage
### Dependencies
* [Python 3.6+](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* [PyTorch 0.4.0+](http://pytorch.org/)
* [PyWt](https://pypi.org/project/PyWt/)

### Downloading the [RESIDE](http://t.cn/RQXyZFI ) dataset
We only use images in clear and haze folders
All claar images are divided as training images (train_clear), testing images (train_hazy).
The hazy images should be placed to corresponding folders (val_clear and val_hazy).

###  Training
```bash
$ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py --epochs 100 \
                --lr 1e-4 \
                --use_gpu true \
                --gpu 0 \
                --ori_data_path /train_clear/ \
                --haze_data_path /train_hazy \
                --val_ori_data_path /val_clear/ \
                --val_haze_data_path /val_hazy/ \
                --num_workers 4 \
                --batch_size 10 \
                --val_batch_size 2 \
                --print_gap 500 \
                --model_dir /model/ \
                --log_dir /model/ \
                --sample_output_folder /samples/ \
                --net_name /dehaze_chromatic_
